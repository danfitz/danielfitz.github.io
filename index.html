            <p>Paragraph 1. I'm going to talk about something random here. Maybe fish sticks. Those are pretty tasty. Anything fried, really, is going to taste pretty good. It's just fat.</p>
            <p>Paragraph 2. This is just me talking about duck curry. Who knew duck kind of tasted like goat? Who knew? A bird and a four-legged mammal taste so similar. Crazy.</p>
