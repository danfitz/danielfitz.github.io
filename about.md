Hi! Glad to see you here. I'm [Thi](https://dinhanhthi.com). I created this site firstly for my personal note taking and now, I wanna share it with you. For me, people cannot remember everything, you must take note what you have learnt. It's useful if you can put your note online and you are able to see it everytime, everywhere with just a phone. That's the reason why this theme was born. 

I modified this theme much from the theme MatJek so that you can use it for note taking. Please read [Welcome to NoteTheme]({{ site.baseurl }}/welcome-to-notetheme) for more information and [How to use NoteTheme]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-use-notetheme) to know how to use and modify this theme for your purpose.
