## The situation

Today, I applied for an executive assistant position for The Centre of Humane Technology (CHT, http://humanetech.com).

At first, I was scared and thought I could never get the position. But then I remembered that when people apply to scholarships, they tend to underestimate their odds, which means less people apply, *which means* if you do end up actually applying, you have a greater chance of getting the scholarship. Similarly, I rationalized that the executive assistant position could be similar. I don't know if I'll get it or not. But if I don't try, I know I *definitely* won't get it.

So I spent 3 hours drafting a 250-word answer for why I think I'm a great fit for the role + a 250-word answer for why I'm personally interested in CHT's cause, i.e., supporting the development of technology that serves (rather than undermines) humanity.

I'm going to paste it here for reference in the future:

*What makes you a great fit for this role?*

What I bring to the table is a trauma-driven obsession with organization. I spent my entire childhood feeling empty inside, searching for something to fill that hole and instead falling on video games, social media, and online porn to do it.

I know what it means to live in a distracted world.

And that's why I organize obsessively: because organizing, for me, is my only lifeline to keep the distractions at bay and really live as my full authentic self.

I've never been an executive assistant before, but I've always believed I would kick ass. I have a tendency to freak people out with how much I organize.

I spent a year tracking my startup's runway: http://bit.ly/2BXu6Lm. (I sadly failed at the startup, but I plan to try again after learning some code.)

I also track my financial goals (http://bit.ly/2EIGP7N), my friendships (http://bit.ly/2nB0O16), my porn use correlated with my motivation levels (http://bit.ly/2nEnWvt).

I even developed my own organization system for self-use: http://bit.ly/2nK9JMN.

Organization is just one of my top skills. Combined with my desire to enter into the tech industry, sobered by my first-hand understanding of tech's dangers, I believe I could be a great fit at CHT.

Thanks for your time. And thank you for the opportunity to apply! I hope you have a great day!

And keep doing what you're doing! I really look forward to the work that you guys do!

*Why does Center for Humane Technology's work matter to you personally?*

I think the greatest tragedy in the world is not living your fullest happiest self. Half-living feels like half-dying to me, a wasted use of what could have been a beautiful life.

I guess it comes back to the fact that I know what it's like to feel really empty inside. To have no purpose, no one to love, nothing to live for. Just video games, movies, and porn.

It would be great if I was the only one who suffered from half-living. But when I look at the world we live in today, I'm really worried that too many of us don't have our own best interests in mind--and so never really live our best selves.

For example, the Harvard Study of Adult Development found that the greatest predictor of life satisfaction was relationships. Yet so many of us replace our friendships with likes and tags and celebrity obsessions.

When I was in San Francisco for the 2016 Effective Altruism conference, a lot of people talked either about the importance of ending extreme poverty--our past--or mitigating existential risk--our future. But what about our present?

There are billions of us dealing with unique problems like the paradox of choice, media manipulation, information overload, and distractions. And over the next century, billions more will enter our digital modern age. Our problems will become their problems too.

From a pure arithmetic point-of-view, if everyone in the world only half-lived, it would be equivalent to mass-killing half of the world population.

I want to make sure that doesn't happen.

## The emotional struggle

After writing out my application, I feel overly hopeful. I suppose it's kind of human nature: when you're faced with the possibility of something awesome (like a cool job or $1 million), you start dreaming of that becoming a reality.

I think that's fine on its own. But for me, I get overly attached to that dream and lose sight of what's right in front of me. I don't want that to happen to me.

In particular, I need to continue to focus on learning programming. I've just started to learn Swift. I need to get back on track and just get back to work. I can't forget my goal of learning programming.

I need to mentally prepare myself for the very real possibility that I probably won't get the job. I'm sure there are tons of more qualified people out there. I think if I were ever to get the job, it would be because the team decides to take a chance on me.

I know this all already. I simply write it out, so I can remind myself of what really matters.
