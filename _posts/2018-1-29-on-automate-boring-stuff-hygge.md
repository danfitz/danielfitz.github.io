## The work

I’m spending a lot of time coding nowadays. Not enough. But quite a bit. I use harvestapp.com to track my work hours, and I tend to log around 20+ hours/week just coding. It’s probably more than I was working before I started coding... I would like to bump it up to 40-60 hours/week though.

My coding focus been on automatetheboringstuff.com. It’s pretty empowering the things you can do to with Python to optimize your daily workflow.

So far, I’ve enjoyed coding. There was a period of disinterest I had around the time I was learning Chapter 10 - Debugging, but I got over it. I think that I have a danger where I will give up on something if I get sad or bored with it. I told myself this time though that I won’t give up. I’ll keep pushing, even through those sad or bored times. I can’t afford to give up anymore. I need to stick to my goals and see them through.

## My mental life
I’ve felt really good for the last 2 weeks since returning from Mississauga, Ontario and coming back to Montreal, Quebec.

The secret?

### **Hygge**

I’ve basically made my nights full of cozy fatty foods, hot tea, crackers, candles, and lying down to movie/TV binges 4+ hours long. It’s really fun doing it with my partner every night.

I feel relaxed and good. Hygge really seems to work. It’s honestly exceeded my expectations. So many life hacks or tricks promise huge jumps in happiness, but it’s rare to actually come across one that actually delivers.
